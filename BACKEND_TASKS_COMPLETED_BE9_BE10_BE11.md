# Backend Tasks Completion Summary (BE-9 to BE-11)

## ✅ BE-9: Payment Request Creation (COMPLETED)

### Overview
Implemented automatic payment creation when record status changes to "completed". Payment is created with deposit deduction logic for online bookings.

### Files Created/Modified

#### 1. payment-service/src/utils/eventHandlers.js (NEW)
**Purpose:** Handle payment lifecycle events from RabbitMQ

**Key Functions:**
- `handlePaymentCreate(eventData)`: Creates Payment record from record.completed event
  - Status: PENDING
  - Method: CASH (default)
  - Deposit treated as discountAmount
  - Publishes payment.created event

- `handleCashPaymentConfirm(eventData)`: Confirms cash payment
  - Updates payment status to COMPLETED
  - Calculates changeAmount
  - Publishes payment.success to invoice_queue

- `publishPaymentSuccess(payment)`: Emits payment.success event
  - Triggers invoice creation
  - Includes full payment details

#### 2. payment-service/src/index.js (MODIFIED)
**Changes:**
- Added event listener initialization
- Imports handlePaymentCreate and handleCashPaymentConfirm
- Consumes payment_queue for payment.create and payment.cash_confirm events

**Code:**
```javascript
const { handlePaymentCreate, handleCashPaymentConfirm } = require('./utils/eventHandlers');

async function startEventListeners() {
  await rabbitmqClient.consumeQueue('payment_queue', async (message) => {
    if (message.event === 'payment.create') await handlePaymentCreate(message);
    else if (message.event === 'payment.cash_confirm') await handleCashPaymentConfirm(message);
  });
}
```

#### 3. payment-service/src/services/payment.service.js (MODIFIED)
**Added Method:** `confirmCashPayment(paymentId, confirmData, processedBy)`

**Logic:**
- Validates payment exists and is pending
- Updates status to completed
- Calculates changeAmount = paidAmount - finalAmount
- Publishes payment.success event to invoice_queue
- Returns updated payment with changeAmount

**Location:** Lines 1050-1117

#### 4. payment-service/src/controllers/payment.controller.js (MODIFIED)
**Added Controller:** `confirmCashPayment(req, res)`

**Endpoint:** POST /:id/confirm-cash

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "paidAmount": 500000,
  "notes": "Optional notes"
}
```

**Validation:**
- paidAmount must be > 0

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Xác nhận thanh toán tiền mặt thành công",
  "data": {
    "_id": "...",
    "paymentCode": "PAY...",
    "status": "completed",
    "finalAmount": 400000,
    "paidAmount": 500000,
    "changeAmount": 100000,
    ...
  }
}
```

**Location:** Lines 770-816

#### 5. payment-service/src/routes/payment.route.js (MODIFIED)
**Added Route:**
```javascript
router.post('/:id/confirm-cash', 
  roleMiddleware(['admin', 'manager', 'dentist', 'receptionist']),
  paymentController.confirmCashPayment
);
```

**Authorization:** Staff only (admin, manager, dentist, receptionist)

#### 6. appointment-service/src/utils/eventListeners.js (MODIFIED)
**Enhanced:** `handleRecordCompleted(data)`

**Payment Creation Logic:**
```javascript
// Calculate total amount
let totalAmount = data.totalCost || appointment.servicePrice || 0;

// Deduct deposit for online bookings
if (appointment.bookingChannel === 'online' && appointment.paymentId) {
  const depositPerSlot = scheduleConfig?.depositAmount || 100000;
  const slotCount = appointment.slotIds?.length || 1;
  depositToDeduct = depositPerSlot * slotCount;
}

const finalAmount = Math.max(0, totalAmount - depositToDeduct);

// Publish payment.create event
await publishToQueue('payment_queue', {
  event: 'payment.create',
  data: {
    recordId,
    appointmentId,
    originalAmount,
    depositDeducted,
    finalAmount,
    patientInfo,
    dentistInfo
  }
});
```

## ✅ BE-10: Invoice Creation on Payment Success (COMPLETED)

### Overview
Implemented automatic invoice creation when payment is successfully completed (cash or VNPay). Invoice is linked back to the record.

### Files Created/Modified

#### 1. invoice-service/src/utils/eventListeners.js (MODIFIED)
**Added Function:** `handlePaymentSuccess(data)`

**Logic:**
- Check if invoice already exists (prevent duplicates)
- Generate unique invoice code: INVyyyyMMddNNNN
- Create Invoice record with payment details
- Create InvoiceDetail record (optional, based on existing pattern)
- Publish invoice.created event to record_queue

**Event Consumed:** payment.success from invoice_queue

**Code Structure:**
```javascript
async function handlePaymentSuccess(data) {
  const {
    paymentId,
    paymentCode,
    recordId,
    appointmentId,
    patientInfo,
    method,
    originalAmount,
    discountAmount,
    finalAmount,
    paidAmount,
    changeAmount,
    completedAt
  } = data;
  
  // Check duplicate
  const existingInvoice = await Invoice.findOne({ 
    $or: [
      { 'paymentSummary.paymentId': paymentId },
      { recordId: recordId }
    ]
  });
  
  if (existingInvoice) return existingInvoice;
  
  // Generate code
  const invoiceCode = await generateInvoiceCode();
  
  // Create invoice
  const invoice = await Invoice.create({
    invoiceCode,
    appointmentId,
    recordId,
    patientInfo,
    subtotal: originalAmount,
    discountInfo: {
      discountAmount,
      discountReason: discountAmount > 0 ? 'Trừ tiền cọc' : null
    },
    totalAmount: finalAmount,
    paymentSummary: {
      paidAmount,
      paymentMethod: method,
      paymentStatus: 'paid',
      paymentId
    },
    status: 'paid'
  });
  
  // Publish event
  await rabbitmqClient.publishToQueue('record_queue', {
    event: 'invoice.created',
    data: { invoiceId, invoiceCode, recordId }
  });
  
  return invoice;
}
```

**Setup in eventListeners:**
```javascript
// Listen to invoice_queue for payment.success events
await rabbitmqClient.consumeQueue('invoice_queue', async (message) => {
  if (message.event === 'payment.success') {
    await handlePaymentSuccess(message.data);
  }
});
```

#### 2. record-service/src/index.js (MODIFIED)
**Added Event Handler:** invoice.created

**Logic:**
- Listens on record_queue for invoice.created event
- Updates Record.invoiceId when invoice is created
- Logs success/error

**Code:**
```javascript
await consumeQueue('record_queue', async (message) => {
  if (message.event === 'appointment_checked_in') {
    await handleAppointmentCheckedIn(message);
  } else if (message.event === 'invoice.created') {
    try {
      const { recordId, invoiceId, invoiceCode } = message.data;
      const Record = require('./models/Record.model');
      
      console.log('[Record] Updating record with invoiceId:', {
        recordId,
        invoiceId,
        invoiceCode
      });
      
      await Record.findByIdAndUpdate(
        recordId,
        { invoiceId: invoiceId },
        { new: true }
      );
      
      console.log('[Record] Successfully updated record with invoiceId');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[Record] Error updating record with invoiceId:', error);
    }
  }
});
```

#### 3. payment-service/src/services/payment.service.js (MODIFIED)
**Enhanced:** `processGatewayCallback(callbackData)`

**Added payment.success event for VNPay:**
```javascript
// After creating VNPay payment
const payment = await paymentRepository.create(paymentData);

// 🔥 CRITICAL: Publish payment.success for invoice creation
await rabbitmqClient.publishToQueue('invoice_queue', {
  event: 'payment.success',
  data: {
    paymentId: payment._id.toString(),
    paymentCode: payment.paymentCode,
    recordId: null, // VNPay deposit doesn't have recordId yet
    appointmentId: null,
    patientId: payment.patientId,
    patientInfo: patientInfo,
    method: 'vnpay',
    originalAmount: paymentAmount,
    discountAmount: 0,
    finalAmount: paymentAmount,
    paidAmount: paymentAmount,
    changeAmount: 0,
    completedAt: payment.processedAt
  }
});
```

**Purpose:** Ensures VNPay payments also trigger invoice creation, just like cash payments

#### 4. payment-service/src/routes/payment.route.js (MODIFIED)
**Added Route:** GET /by-record/:recordId

```javascript
router.get('/by-record/:recordId', 
  roleMiddleware(['admin', 'manager', 'dentist', 'receptionist']),
  paymentController.getPaymentByRecordId
);
```

**Authorization:** Staff only

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "_id": "...",
    "paymentCode": "PAY...",
    "recordId": "...",
    "status": "pending",
    "finalAmount": 400000,
    ...
  },
  "total": 1
}
```

#### 5. payment-service/src/controllers/payment.controller.js (MODIFIED)
**Added Controller:** `getPaymentByRecordId(req, res)`

**Logic:**
- Calls paymentService.getPaymentsByRecordId(recordId)
- Returns first payment (usually only one per record)
- Returns 404 if no payment found

**Location:** Lines 277-308

#### 6. payment-service/src/services/payment.service.js (MODIFIED)
**Added Method:** `getPaymentsByRecordId(recordId)`

```javascript
async getPaymentsByRecordId(recordId) {
  const payments = await paymentRepository.findByRecord(recordId);
  return payments;
}
```

**Repository Method:** Uses existing `paymentRepository.findByRecord(recordId)`

[Payment] Processing payment.create event: {...}
[Payment] Payment created: PAY...
[Payment] Confirming cash payment: {...}
[Payment] Publishing payment.success event...
✅ [Payment] payment.success event published
```

[Invoice] Invoice already exists: INV... (if duplicate)
[Invoice] Created invoice: INV...
[Invoice] Published invoice.created event
```

#### Record Service
```
[Record] Updating record with invoiceId: {...}
[Record] Successfully updated record with invoiceId
```

---

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All services have correct RabbitMQ URL
- [ ] VNPay credentials configured
- [ ] Frontend URL configured for redirects
- [ ] Staff authentication working
- [ ] Role-based access control enabled
- [ ] Database indexes created (invoiceCode, paymentCode, recordId)
- [ ] RabbitMQ queues created and durable
- [ ] Redis connection for payment temporary data
- [ ] Cron jobs enabled for auto status updates
- [ ] Error monitoring setup (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Log aggregation setup (ELK, CloudWatch, etc.)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Payment by RecordId Query:** Only returns first payment (assumes one payment per record)
2. **VNPay Invoice:** Invoice created immediately after VNPay payment, before appointment created (recordId/appointmentId may be null initially)
3. **Duplicate Invoice Prevention:** Based on paymentId and recordId - if both change, duplicate could occur
4. **Change Calculation:** Only for cash payments, not applicable to VNPay/Visa
5. **Invoice Details:** Currently minimal, may need to add itemized services/medications

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Partial Payments:** Support multiple payments for one record
2. **Refund Logic:** Implement refund flow with invoice adjustment
3. **Payment Reminders:** Send notifications for pending payments
4. **Invoice Email:** Auto-send invoice to patient email
5. **Payment History:** Patient-facing payment history page
6. **Invoice PDF:** Generate PDF invoices
7. **Receipt Printing:** Thermal printer integration
8. **Analytics:** Payment statistics dashboard
