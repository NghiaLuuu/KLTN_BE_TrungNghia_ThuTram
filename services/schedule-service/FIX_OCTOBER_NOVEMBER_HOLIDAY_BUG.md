# Fix: October/November Holiday Detection Bug

## üêõ Problem Description

**Symptom:** When creating schedules, holiday detection skips the wrong days:
- **October/November 2024**: Skips **Monday (Th·ª© 2)** instead of Sunday (Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t)
- **December 2024**: Correctly skips **Sunday (Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t)**

This is a **critical production bug** affecting schedule accuracy.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Timeline of Events

1. **Initial Bug (Before Fix)**
   - `recurringHolidays` collection had **wrong `dayOfWeek` values**
   - Example: Sunday might have been stored as `dayOfWeek: 7` or `dayOfWeek: 2` instead of `dayOfWeek: 1`
   - Caused by mixing local time and UTC methods

2. **October/November Schedule Creation**
   - Schedules created when bug existed
   - `computeDaysOff()` function used **wrong holiday data** from database
   - Generated `computedDaysOff` array with **incorrect dates**
   - This snapshot saved to schedule document

3. **Bug Fix Applied**
   - Fixed timezone handling (all UTC methods)
   - Fixed dayOfWeek conversion: `getUTCDay() + 1` (0‚Üí1, 1‚Üí2, etc.)
   - Corrected `recurringHolidays` data in database

4. **December Schedule Creation**
   - Schedule created **after** bug fix
   - `computeDaysOff()` used **corrected holiday data**
   - Generated correct `computedDaysOff`
   - Works perfectly

### How `isHolidayFromSnapshot()` Works

```javascript
function isHolidayFromSnapshot(date, holidaySnapshot) {
  // PRIORITY 1: Check pre-computed days off (if exists)
  if (holidaySnapshot.computedDaysOff && holidaySnapshot.computedDaysOff.length > 0) {
    return holidaySnapshot.computedDaysOff.some(day => day.date === dateStr);
  }
  
  // FALLBACK: Manual check using recurringHolidays + nonRecurringHolidays
  const dayOfWeek = checkDate.getUTCDay() + 1;
  const isRecurringHoliday = recurringHolidays.some(h => h.dayOfWeek === dayOfWeek);
  return isRecurringHoliday || isNonRecurringHoliday;
}
```

**The Problem:**
- October/November schedules have `computedDaysOff` with **pre-computed wrong data**
- Priority path is used ‚Üí Returns wrong results
- December schedules have correct `computedDaysOff` ‚Üí Works fine

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Migration Strategy

**Goal:** Regenerate `computedDaysOff` for all existing schedules using current (corrected) holiday data.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Re-fetch current `recurringHolidays` from database (corrected values)
2. Re-run `computeDaysOff()` function for each schedule's date range
3. **Preserve existing shift override status** (important!)
4. Update `holidaySnapshot.computedDaysOff` in schedule documents

### Files Created

#### 1. `verify-holiday-issue.js` - Verification Script
**Purpose:** Diagnose the issue before fixing

**Usage:**
```bash
cd services/schedule-service
node verify-holiday-issue.js
```

**What it does:**
- Shows current `recurringHolidays` in database
- Checks Oct/Nov/Dec 2024 schedules
- Analyzes `computedDaysOff` for each schedule
- Counts Sundays vs Mondays detected
- Identifies schedules with wrong data

**Example Output:**
```
üìã Current Recurring Holidays in DB:
   Ngh·ªâ Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t: dayOfWeek=1 (Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t)

üìÖ Checking October 2024...
   Found 2 schedule(s)
   
   üìÑ Schedule ID: 673abc123...
      computedDaysOff count: 5
      First 5 computed days off:
         2024-10-07 (Th·ª© 2, dayOfWeek=2): Ngh·ªâ Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t  ‚Üê WRONG!
         2024-10-14 (Th·ª© 2, dayOfWeek=2): Ngh·ªâ Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t  ‚Üê WRONG!
      
      üîç Analysis:
         Sundays detected: 0
         Mondays detected: 5
         ‚ö†Ô∏è  ISSUE FOUND: No Sundays but has Mondays!
```

#### 2. `fix-computed-daysoff-migration.js` - Migration Script
**Purpose:** Fix the issue by regenerating `computedDaysOff`

**Usage:**
```bash
cd services/schedule-service
node fix-computed-daysoff-migration.js
```

**What it does:**
1. Finds all schedules in database
2. For each schedule:
   - Re-fetches current holiday data
   - Re-generates `computedDaysOff` using corrected data
   - **Preserves shift override status** from old data
   - Updates schedule document
3. Shows summary of changes

**Example Output:**
```
üìÖ Processing Schedule: 10/2024 (ID: 673abc123...)
   Old computedDaysOff count: 5
   New computedDaysOff count: 4
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Day count changed: 5 ‚Üí 4
   Sample days (first 3):
      2024-10-06 (Sunday): Ngh·ªâ Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t  ‚Üê CORRECT!
      2024-10-13 (Sunday): Ngh·ªâ Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t  ‚Üê CORRECT!
   ‚úÖ Updated successfully

üìä Migration Summary:
   ‚úÖ Updated: 25
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: 0
   ‚ùå Errors: 0
   üìù Total: 25
   
üéâ Migration completed successfully!
```

### Important: Preserving Shift Overrides

The migration script **preserves** any existing shift overrides:

```javascript
// If a date exists in both old and new computedDaysOff
const oldDay = oldComputedDaysOff.find(d => d.date === newDay.date);

if (oldDay && oldDay.shifts) {
  // Preserve override status from old data
  return {
    ...newDay,
    shifts: {
      morning: oldDay.shifts.morning || newDay.shifts.morning,
      afternoon: oldDay.shifts.afternoon || newDay.shifts.afternoon,
      evening: oldDay.shifts.evening || newDay.shifts.evening
    }
  };
}
```

This ensures that any holidays that were already overridden (slots created) maintain their override status after migration.

## üöÄ Execution Steps

### Step 1: Verify the Issue
```bash
cd c:\Users\ADMINS\Downloads\KLTN\BE_KLTN_TrungNghia_ThuTram\services\schedule-service
node verify-holiday-issue.js
```

**Expected Result:**
- October/November: Shows Mondays detected instead of Sundays
- December: Shows Sundays detected correctly

### Step 2: Backup Database (IMPORTANT!)
```bash
# MongoDB backup
mongodump --db kltn_db --out backup_before_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Step 3: Run Migration
```bash
node fix-computed-daysoff-migration.js
```

**Expected Result:**
- All schedules updated with correct `computedDaysOff`
- Shift overrides preserved
- Summary shows number of updated schedules

### Step 4: Verify Fix
```bash
node verify-holiday-issue.js
```

**Expected Result:**
- All months now show Sundays detected correctly
- No more Mondays being detected as holidays

### Step 5: Test Schedule Creation
1. Open frontend application
2. Navigate to "T·∫°o l·ªãch l√†m vi·ªác"
3. Create a test schedule for October 2024
4. Verify that Sundays (not Mondays) are skipped
5. Check generated slots to ensure no Sunday slots exist

## üìä Technical Details

### DayOfWeek Convention

**Our System (Database):**
- `1` = Sunday (Ch·ªß nh·∫≠t)
- `2` = Monday (Th·ª© 2)
- `3` = Tuesday (Th·ª© 3)
- `4` = Wednesday (Th·ª© 4)
- `5` = Thursday (Th·ª© 5)
- `6` = Friday (Th·ª© 6)
- `7` = Saturday (Th·ª© 7)

**JavaScript `Date.getUTCDay()`:**
- `0` = Sunday
- `1` = Monday
- `2` = Tuesday
- `3` = Wednesday
- `4` = Thursday
- `5` = Friday
- `6` = Saturday

**dayjs `.day()`:**
- Same as JavaScript: `0` = Sunday, `1` = Monday, etc.

**Conversion Formula:**
```javascript
// Convert JavaScript day (0-6) to our convention (1-7)
const dayOfWeek = jsDay + 1;

// For Sunday specifically:
// jsDay = 0 ‚Üí dayOfWeek = 1 ‚úÖ

// For Monday specifically:
// jsDay = 1 ‚Üí dayOfWeek = 2 ‚úÖ
```

### Files Modified

**New Files:**
- `services/schedule-service/verify-holiday-issue.js` - Verification script
- `services/schedule-service/fix-computed-daysoff-migration.js` - Migration script
- `services/schedule-service/FIX_OCTOBER_NOVEMBER_HOLIDAY_BUG.md` - This documentation

**Existing Files (Already Fixed):**
- `services/schedule-service/src/services/schedule.service.js`
  - Line 27-95: `computeDaysOff()` - Uses correct conversion
  - Line 620-660: `isHolidayFromSnapshot()` - Uses correct conversion
  - Line 2022-2293: `createScheduleOverrideHoliday()` - Uses correct conversion

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After migration, verify:

- [ ] October 2024 schedules skip Sundays (not Mondays)
- [ ] November 2024 schedules skip Sundays (not Mondays)
- [ ] December 2024 schedules still skip Sundays correctly
- [ ] New schedules for any month skip correct days
- [ ] Existing shift overrides still work
- [ ] "T·∫°o l·ªãch l√†m vi·ªác trong ng√†y ngh·ªâ" modal still works
- [ ] Holiday override slots still show correct information

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Restore from backup:**
   ```bash
   mongorestore --db kltn_db backup_before_migration_YYYYMMDD/kltn_db
   ```

2. **Or revert individual schedules:**
   ```javascript
   // In MongoDB shell or Compass
   db.schedules.updateMany(
     { month: 10, year: 2024 },
     { $set: { 'holidaySnapshot.computedDaysOff': [] } }
   )
   ```
   This will force schedules to use fallback logic (which is also fixed now)

## üìù Related Issues Fixed

This migration also fixes:
- ‚úÖ Timezone bugs in holiday detection
- ‚úÖ DayOfWeek conversion errors
- ‚úÖ Inconsistent behavior between different months
- ‚úÖ Shift-level tracking in computedDaysOff (already has shifts structure)

## üéØ Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:
1. All schedules have correct `computedDaysOff` with Sundays (dayOfWeek=1)
2. No schedules have Mondays incorrectly marked as holidays
3. Existing shift overrides are preserved
4. New schedule creation works correctly for all months
5. Holiday override feature continues to work

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Run during low traffic period** - Migration updates all schedules
2. **Backup database first** - Always have a rollback plan
3. **Test on staging environment** - If available
4. **Monitor after deployment** - Check for any unexpected behavior
5. **Shift overrides are preserved** - Existing holiday override slots remain valid
